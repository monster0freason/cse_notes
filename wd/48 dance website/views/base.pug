//- 159.1 In Pug (formerly known as Jade), template inheritance allows you to build a base template that includes common elements, such as a header and footer, and then extend that template for specific pages. This allows you to avoid duplicating common code across multiple templates. The extends keyword is used to inherit from a parent template, and the block keyword is used to define areas that can be overridden in child templates.
